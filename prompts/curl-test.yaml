Curl Test:
 - register a new user if needed (check if test user exists first)
 - login to get auth token
 - save the token for subsequent requests
 - run curl tests on the endpoint/key provided by user
 - use the auth token in all authenticated requests
 - show full curl commands with headers and body
 - display response status, headers, and body
 - handle errors gracefully and show error details
 - the user will pass the key/endpoint to test
